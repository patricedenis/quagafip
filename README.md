The initial commit is a pull from source's code developed during my student's and PhD's years.
Lots of work is needed to enhance to portability and usability of this project.
Still, this is my first attempt to open source, so I will learn during the process.
Keep in mind that the dependencies of this project are not licensed under the same condition,
report to the dependencies projects for more information.
One of those dependencies was to use ImageMagick's primitives for the manipulation of images.

When I looked back to this source code, I found that the documentation is yet to be written
and also that an effort to translate French to English will also be much appropriate.

That work will be done in future releases if time is made available.

See content.txt for a brief description on source files.
